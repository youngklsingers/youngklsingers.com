Music can be a lot of things to different people: it can remind you of something, somewhere or someone, it can elicit emotions.

The sense of adventure and epic saga to expect when you hear the main theme to 
[Star Wars](https://youtu.be/_D0ZQPqeJkk) or 
[The Legend of Zelda](https://youtu.be/cGufy1PAeTU). The dread when you hear the theme from 
[Jaws](https://youtu.be/lV8i-pSVMaQ). The feeling of awe and terror from 
[Karl Jenkin's 'Dies Irae'](https://youtu.be/7RirEqehfsg) from his Requiem. The spiralling feeling of despair when 
[Lux Aeterna](https://youtu.be/hiNvk4xizc0) from Requiem For A Dream starts to play. That calm pleasure of 
[Pachelbel's Canon in D](https://youtu.be/4dZxt60As84). Even the sudden lack of music can trigger a sense of finality.

Music is used to great effect to prepare its audience for what's to come.

Most of the time music is used to accompany a scene or an event, but how about when you hear a piece of music without any setting? What imagery does your mind fill in its place?

A YKLS concert usually would have costumes and choreography to accompany the music (instead of the other way around!). This time you have the opportunity to interpret it as you will.

Some words used to describe the pieces we're performing?...Well, let's not spoil it for you. It'll be like telling you not to think of pink elephants. It's best when you experience it for yourself!

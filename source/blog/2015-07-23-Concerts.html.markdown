**2016: YKLS Does The Bard**

"Raw and uncut, live and unplugged" are the modern translation of how William Shakespeare's plays were staged more than 400 years ago before his passing. Despite his tragic death at 52, the legacy of the Bard of Avon lives on and continues to inspire artists and musicians alike to interpret his works in various ways.

This November, the Young KL Singers brings to you a programme of music set to the poetry and text of William Shakespeare, performed in an intimate cabaret setting for a heartfelt celebration with the audience the love of music and literature. A fine set of repertoire was crafted with aims to broaden views on the relationship between genres
of art and draw a truly personal experience.

**[2015: Illuminations](http://www.youngklsingers.com/concerts/concert-2015-illuminations/)**
If a picture is a thousand words, music is a thousand pictures. Each rise and fall, each silence in between is a feeling, an image, a memory.

Now if you close your eyes, would the music be different?

Would the colours burn brighter, clearer than ever?

Join YKLS as we search for the answers. Let your mind dance away, down the secret paths to wondrous worlds of your own imagination...and let the music light your way.

After every production, there's always that lull near the end of the year where members get restless because there are no more rehearsals, no more singing and no more meeting up until next year. And so to help alleviate choir withdrawal symptoms, sometimes there's the post-production viewing party and carolling rehearsals.

Carolling!

That is, if we're lucky and have been approached for a gig 
**and**
 if we get enough members to participate - after all, carolling gigs tend to be held near Christmas when everyone will have their own celebrations and holidays. But once all that has been worked out, it's back to the good old Monday rehearsals and singing! No more choir withdrawal symptoms!

Anyway, here are some videos of YKLS carolling to bring you some Christmas cheer! First up, a video from Publika highlighting their Christmas entertainment!

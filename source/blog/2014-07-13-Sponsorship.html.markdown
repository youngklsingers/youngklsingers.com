Help us continue to keep choral music affordable and accessible in Malaysia! YKLS needs sponsorship for two main reasons:**(1) Cover production costs, such as equipment and production space rental.**

**(2) Fund tickets for underprivileged groups to attend the Charity Matinee show.**
Every year , YKLS dedicates our Saturday afternoon show to the underprivileged as our way of sharing the joy of music with those who have less then we do. Past organisations have included Rumah Hope, Rumah Impian, Malaysian Association of the Blind, Magic, Agathian Shelter Home, RACTAR, NASOM, and Dignity.

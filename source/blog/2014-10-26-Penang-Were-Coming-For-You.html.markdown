We can't thank everybody enough for theÂ amazing KL run of Incantations!

We certainly did not expect 3/4 full-house shows, and it was especially great to have performed to the (slightly scared :P) children from PPR Pantai, elderly residents of the Rumah Kebajikan Ci Hang-Chempaka and choir singers from the National Council of the Blind at the Charity Matinee.

So it's Penang this 7-9 Nov, and we promise you it'll be nothing less awesome. As a taster - here's a video on the nonsense we got up to when we took 2013's concert, YKLS.Period, to Penang in January 2014:

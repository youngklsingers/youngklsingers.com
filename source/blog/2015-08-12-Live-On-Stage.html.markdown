Live on Stage is coming! This is an event where members of the Young KL Singers can finally showcase their own thing, whether it be a solo piece, a boy band / girl group / mixed team song, however you want it. As most of the year would be spent preparing for the production this is a time where members can actually perform anything they like, in costume too!

A piece of trivia:>Live on Stage concept actually originated from a small scale Valentine production that we did back in 2003 entitled "Love Is In The Air".

Here're some photos from Live On Stage 2 all the way back in 2005! It's 11 years now since the first Live On Stage!

In 2012 we had witches defying gravity, a merman, and even backup dancers.
Live On Stage did see a change recently in the last few years where it was also used as a form of teambuilding - instead of voluntary performances the director put everyone in teams and we had a (sort of) competition going on!

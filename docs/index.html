            <p class="card-text">For “YKLS ROCKS!” director Ian Chow, this will be his fourth performance outing with the community choir, ever since he first mustered enough courage to pick up the phone to book a slot for auditions back in 2002.
Since then, Chow has produced or been on the advisory committee for almost all YKLS productions, and even stage-managed a few.
Some productions which have stood the test of time for Chow include “Through the Barricade” (2004), performing excerpts from Les Misérables and Miss Saigon musicals; “Beat It, Sing It” (also 2004) a high energy performance singing ethnic music with a 3-piece percussion backing; and “Together As One” (2010), which had YKLS members from different walks of life singing songs from different faiths and religions.</p>

            <p class="card-text">From the 60&rsquo;s to the new millennium, from classic rock to hard rock to alternative to fusion rock (among many others), The Young KL Singers (YKLS) will be pouring their hearts out to celebrate their 15th Anniversary with the production, YKLS Rocks!
Presented in two contrasting halves, chronological vs sub-genres, the audience will be brought through a choral journey of rock music backed by ETA, a 4-piece band. The first half of the programme will showcase the choir&rsquo;s vocal prowess with a more mean and lean direction meanwhile you can expect a lighter second half done a la &ldquo;sing-off&rdquo; format.</p>

            <p class="card-text">&ldquo;Raw and uncut, live and unplugged&rdquo; are the modern translation of how William Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were staged more than 400 years ago before his passing. Despite his tragic death at 52, the legacy of the Bard of Avon lives on and continues to inspire artists and musicians alike to interpret his works in various ways.
This November, the Young KL Singers brings to you a programme of music set to the poetry and text of William Shakespeare, performed in an intimate cabaret setting for a heartfelt celebration with the audience the love of music and literature.</p>

A special collaborative project between YKLS and The Actors Studio, &ldquo;YKLS Does The Bard&rdquo; was held from 3rd to 6th Nov 2016 at Pentas 2, KLPAC. In a very intimate and contemporary cabaret-style setting, we presented 15 choral settings of Shakespearean text which explored the universal themes of life, love and loss.</p>

So here&rsquo;s four random facts about YKLS and choir in general.1. Four, Squared There are four main vocal parts in a choir: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.
There was one time when even the four parts were further split into 4 parts each: Soprano 1a, Soprano 1b, Soprano 2a, Soprano 2b, Alto 1a, Alto 1b, Alto 2a, Alto 2b, Tenor 1a, Tenor 1b, Tenor 2a, Tenor 2b, Bass 1a, Bass 1b, Bass 2a and Bass 2b!</p>

            <p class="card-text">It&rsquo;s five more days until Christmas Around The World! And while waiting for the weekend, let&rsquo;s have a little guessing game about the production!
As the name implies, YKLS will be bringing you nativity songs from around the world and not just the usual Christmas carols we&rsquo;re all used to. Just as with our last Christmas production (The YKLS Christmas Project), the songs may not necessarily be in English - we introduced a few other carols in French, Spanish and even in English that&rsquo;s not commonly heard here!</p>

            <p class="card-text">After every production, there&rsquo;s always that lull near the end of the year where members get restless because there are no more rehearsals, no more singing and no more meeting up until next year. And so to help alleviate choir withdrawal symptoms, sometimes there&rsquo;s the post-production viewing party and carolling rehearsals.
Carolling!

That is, if we&rsquo;re lucky and have been approached for a gig and if we get enough members to participate - after all, carolling gigs tend to be held near Christmas when everyone will have their own celebrations and holidays.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Hello folks! The long weekend is coming! And with that, another year of independence! As with most Malaysians, the Young KL Singers will also be taking a break to celebrate Merdeka! So while we&rsquo;re normally known for singing in public, we won&rsquo;t have a performance this weekend - our next public performance would be to bring you some Christmas cheer!
And so, let&rsquo;s take a look at how the Young KL Singers is a part of Malaysia (except that we aren&rsquo;t 58 years old)!</p>

Rehearsals are starting again tonight, along with auditions for anyone who&rsquo;s interested! Even though Illuminations is over, we still have a surprise in store for you before the end of this year as we bring you some more choral lovin&rsquo;!
For current (and old) members, this means you don&rsquo;t have to wait until next year to get your choir kicks again, and for those interested in singing and performing with the YKLS, this is a chance for you to join in the fun without having to wait until next year!</p>

This is an event where members of the Young KL Singers can finally showcase their own thing, whether it be a solo piece, a boy band / girl group / mixed team song, however you want it. As most of the year would be spent preparing for the production this is a time where members can actually perform anything they like, in costume too!
A piece of trivia:&gt;Live on Stage concept actually originated from a small scale Valentine production that we did back in 2003 entitled &ldquo;Love Is In The Air&rdquo;.</p>

You did? Oh. Okay, then.
 You learn singing techniques to up your game. You pick up loads of new songs and choral arrangements. You experience what it is to be part of a production, from rehearsals to bumping in at the venue to tech runs until the end of the performance.</p>

Given the nature of the concert, Indicine presents an appropriate venue because it&rsquo;s smaller and cosier (so you won&rsquo;t have to strain to hear us from the back row!) and we can keep you all in the dark (literally&hellip;and for now figuratively as well). There&rsquo;s still plenty to do, from preparing the venue to be pitch dark, to testing the sound in the new space, making adjustments and going for dim sum dinner.</p>

The feeling of awe and terror from Karl Jenkin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dies Irae&rsquo; from his Requiem. The spiralling feeling of despair when Lux Aeterna from Requiem For A Dream starts to play.</p>

&ldquo;Raw and uncut, live and unplugged&rdquo; are the modern translation of how William Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were staged more than 400 years ago before his passing. Despite his tragic death at 52, the legacy of the Bard of Avon lives on and continues to inspire artists and musicians alike to interpret his works in various ways.
This November, the Young KL Singers brings to you a programme of music set to the poetry and text of William Shakespeare, performed in an intimate cabaret setting for a heartfelt celebration with the audience the love of music and literature.</p>

            <p class="card-text">If there&rsquo;s one thing about the Young KL Singers, it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s always something new every year - whether it be singalongs from musicals, breaking it down with jazz pieces, celebrating our musical and cultural heritage and even choral music inspired by traditions and rituals all over the world, it&rsquo;s certain that the Young KL Singers are an adventurous bunch to tackle different genres.
This year though, the Young KL Singers are going to be doing something totally different from the previous years.</p>

So it&rsquo;s Penang this 7-9 Nov, and we promise you it&rsquo;ll be nothing less awesome.</p>

<p>Now, if you’ve watched the Little Mermaid, you know that Ariel took forever to get together with Prince Erik because Ursula cast a spell (!) and stole Ariel’s voice.
At YKLS, we learn fast – drawing from Ariel’s harrowing experience, we are very careful in making sure we don’t lose our voices, especially when concert’s only 2 weeks away!</p>

<p>And because we believe everybody can and should sing, whether or not you wish to marry a handsome prince, we would like to share with you:</p>

This year, the Young KL Singers joined the arts and literary world in paying tribute to William Shakespeare, as part of a global celebration of his life and works 400 years after his death. A special collaborative project between YKLS and The Actors Studio, “YKLS Does The Bard” was held from 3rd to 6th Nov 2016 at Pentas 2, KLPAC. In a very intimate and contemporary cabaret-style setting, we presented 15 choral settings of Shakespearean text which explored the universal themes of life, love and loss.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The Young KL Singers (YKLS) is a bunch of 40 people with a few things in common:
(1) We love singing!
(2) We see humour in everything.
(3) Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday night, we spend about two and a half hours or more perfecting our craft.
&hellip;But it&rsquo;s all totally worth it.
So what are you really? 
Very simply, YKLS is a community choir. We’ve got teachers, consultants, central bankers, flight attendants, piano accompanists, voice healers, business owners, interior designers, mothers, students, yoga instructors, traders, pharmacists, et cetera – all of whom feel life would not be complete without spending three nights a week singing, harmonising and having fun doing it.</p>

    <p>Live on Stage is coming! This is an event where members of the Young KL Singers can finally showcase their own thing, whether it be a solo piece, a boy band / girl group / mixed team song, however you want it. As most of the year would be spent preparing for the production this is a time where members can actually perform anything they like, in costume too!</p>

<p>A piece of trivia:&gt;Live on Stage concept actually originated from a small scale Valentine production that we did back in 2003 entitled &ldquo;Love Is In The Air&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Live-On-Stage-2.2.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Live-On-Stage-2.2.jpg" alt="Live On Stage 2.2" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;re some photos from Live On Stage 2 all the way back in 2005! It&rsquo;s 11 years now since the first Live On Stage!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0782.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0782.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In 2012 we had witches defying gravity, a merman, and even backup dancers.
Live On Stage did see a change recently in the last few years where it was also used as a form of teambuilding - instead of voluntary performances the director put everyone in teams and we had a (sort of) competition going on!</p>

<p>After two years of this we&rsquo;re finally back to the previous format! Live On Stage is part of the Young Choral Academy Festival, comprising of
<strong>Spotlight</strong>
 (the Children&rsquo;s Choir solo singing competition),
<strong>The Voice of YCA </strong>
(YCA Youth&rsquo;s Edition singing competition) and 
<strong>Live On Stage</strong>
!</p>

<p>Happening at 8pm this 16th September at Young Choral Academy!</p>

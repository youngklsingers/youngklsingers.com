    <p>It&rsquo;s one more day until Illuminations opens! It&rsquo;s an exciting time as we polish up the performance for your entertainment! And while we&rsquo;re not polishing up our act, we&rsquo;re polishing up our meals.</p>

<p>The Young KL Singers. Big on singing, big on eating.</p>

<p>Especially since we will have two performances each night (more opportunities for you to catch the show)! And as we promised you before: no dim sum (or other food) breath!</p>

<p>As Illuminations is different from our usual shows, here are a few things to bear in mind to make sure everyone has the best possible experience!</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/OpjF7gTWeQE">http://youtu.be/OpjF7gTWeQE</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Please be on time - the ushers will not allow latecomers to enter Indicine once the performance has started. As this production aims to surround the audience in darkness and sound, interruptions such as people coming in late will compromise the atmosphere. The same applies to once the performance has started - minimal movement would be appreciated so do schedule any toilet trips before the show.</p></li>

<li><p>That goes with ensuring that your phone is on silent mode or airplane mode too!</p></li>

<li><p>The setting is meant to be very casual, with mats and bean bags and cushions so you can sit comfortably on the floor to enjoy the show. However, if you prefer a chair those are also available. With this in mind, do dress comfortably!</p></li>

<li><p>Indicine can be rather cold (the air-conditioning is rather powerful) and if it rains it&rsquo;ll be even colder, so you might want to bring along a jacket or scarf or some other means of keeping warm.</p></li>

<li><p>It&rsquo;s going to be dark, so please be mindful of your surroundings and those around you!</p></li>

<li><p>Plan your journey! This weekend is a busy weekend with the Kuala Lumpur City Grand Prix taking place as well. More details on the

</ol>

<p>Really looking forward to sharing the experience of Illuminations with you! See you this weekend!</p>

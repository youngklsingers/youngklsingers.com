        <p class="card-text"><p>Hello folks! The long weekend is coming! And with that, another year of independence! As with most Malaysians, the Young KL Singers will also be taking a break to celebrate Merdeka! So while we&rsquo;re normally known for singing in public, we won&rsquo;t have a performance this weekend - our next public performance would be to bring you some Christmas cheer!</p>

<p>And so, let&rsquo;s take a look at how the Young KL Singers is a part of Malaysia (except that we aren&rsquo;t 58 years old)!</p>

<p>Let us count the ways: Multiethnic. Multicultural. Multilingual. Welcoming. Truly Asia.</p>

<p>Multiethnic and multicultural&hellip;check.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;ve talked about how members of the Young KL Singers come from all professions, we haven&rsquo;t really mentioned that the members aren&rsquo;t necessarily Malaysians. To quote an old member:&gt;Some of the &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; that have sung in the YKLS include Bruno, Valentine and Amandine (French), Bruce and Sue (English), Gabrielle (Australian), Farah and Fakhry (Indonesian) and Rachel (American). I&rsquo;m not including those with mixed parentages.</p>

<p>This quote was in 2006.</p>

<p>As far as this writer remembers, there is also Masako (Japanese), Tristan (Filipino), Sheena (Canadian) and Serene (Singaporean).</p>

<p>We may be the Young KL Singers, but we sure aren&rsquo;t exclusive to just locals only:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of YKLS members travel great distances to attend rehearsals. Chi Hoe travelled each week from Penang, and Sylvia each week from Ipoh. Other &ldquo;long distance&rdquo; travellers include Denise and May Yee from Kajang, and Yeow, Roy, Leonard and Hilda from Klang. The biggest group stays in Subang (commonly known as the Subang gang).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multilingual&hellip;check.</p>

<p>Another quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The different languages sung by the YKLS include:- Mandarin- Malay- English- Spanish- French- Swedish- Estonian- Mongolian (solely consisting of sha, ding, di &amp; li)- Indian (solely consisting of na)- Hokkien- German- Maori- African- Japanese- some South American tribal language- nonsense language. The only major languages not attempted appears to be Arabic and Russian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that was 2006. We can now add Latin, Portuguese, Tagalog, Akan, Finish, Catalan, Norwegian, Hungarian to the mix.</p>

<p>Welcoming&hellip;check.</p>

<p>Auditions are still going on! And you&rsquo;re welcome to come watch our performances!</p>

<p>Truly Asia.</p>

<p>If only because there are mamak nights, dim sum dinners, durian buffet outings to show you our passion of food. But there&rsquo;s also this: a song composed by an Ipohan (Tracy Wong), with lyrics from Kajang (Denise Kong), Bangsar (Annette Christie) and Kelantan (Ryonn Leong). And it does capture that Malaysian essence:</p>

<p>The result? Kami.</p>

<p>And with that, we&rsquo;ll like to wish you Selamat Hari Merdeka and have a great weekend!</p>

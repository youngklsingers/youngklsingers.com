<p><strong>WHY JOIN US?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I joined for the harmony but also experienced comedy, drama and possibly some therapy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meeting like minded people who enjoyed making beautiful music together - it became like a safe haven for me. I formed life-long friendships and we had many wonderful experiences I will never forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went into YKLS but never came back out. Not because I was lost, it&rsquo;s because I have found &ldquo;</p>

<p><strong>And this author&rsquo;s favourite (drumroll! Ratatatatata&hellip;) -</strong></p>

<p> &rdquo;I was lonely, and then I found a girlfriend in the choir. 7 years later, we&rsquo;re still in the choir&hellip; AND we&rsquo;re engaged!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>PLUS:</strong></p>

<p>No musical or singing background required.</p>

<p>You know you wanna! See you at rehearsals!

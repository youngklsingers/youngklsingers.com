    <p>Originally this was going to be titled &lsquo;8 Perks of Being in YKLS&rsquo; but half of them seem to be pretty much what you expect from joining a choir, and you didn&rsquo;t come here to read about obvious advantages, right?</p>

<p>You did? Oh. Okay, then.</p>

<ol>
<li>You learn singing techniques to up your game.</li>
<li>You pick up loads of new songs and choral arrangements.</li>
<li>You experience what it is to be part of a production, from rehearsals to bumping in at the venue to tech runs until the end of the performance.</li>
<li>You make new friends.</li>
</ol>

<p>So let&rsquo;s move on to the 4 perks you may not really realise that are also great perks of being in the Young KL Singers! Also more pictures!</p>

<p><strong>5. Defeat stress in multiple ways.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/File-03-08-2015-13-34-03.jpeg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/File-03-08-2015-13-34-03.jpeg" alt="File 03-08-2015 13 34 03" /></a>
YKLS provides stress relief in so many ways!</p>

<p>*Rehearsals are generally on Mondays, giving you something to look forward to and thus not get bogged down by the Monday Blues.</p>

<p>*Singing. Cheers. You. Up!</p>

<p>*More often than not you get crazy antics taking place (as you can see in the photo above, no don&rsquo;t worry our producers don&rsquo;t kill people).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/linuschoir.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/linuschoir.jpg" alt="linuschoir" /></a></p>

<p><strong>6. Let your hair down in public.</strong></p>

<p>Because everyone is a bit nutty inside, and you&rsquo;re in good company. Sometimes the nuttiness doesn&rsquo;t just happen within our choir centre, but spills outside into the public. At the mamak and trying to place your order? Call the
 in a four-note chord to grab his attention! Waiting for the train? Sing!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YKLSLetsDoIt-e1405188909927.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YKLSLetsDoIt-e1405188909927.jpg" alt="YKLSLetsDoIt" /></a></p>

<p>Even the station guards weren&rsquo;t prepared to deal with our crazy.</p>

<p>Then there are the post-production cast parties!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1294484_10151733796039103_790307295_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1294484_10151733796039103_790307295_o.jpg" alt="1294484_10151733796039103_790307295_o" /></a></p>

<p>Which are themed. Zombie peasants were wandering about Bangsar one year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Experience performing in other events.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s more than just performing in a Young KL Singers production. Some years there&rsquo;s carolling. YKLS has also performed with the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra in the
Lord of the Rings Symphony and also
Danny Elfman&rsquo;s Music from the Films of Tim Burton. Some years it was participating in Choir Games.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/File-03-08-2015-14-24-12.jpeg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/File-03-08-2015-14-24-12-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="File 03-08-2015 14 24 12" /></a></p>

<p>Every year is always different and refreshingly so!</p>

<p><strong>8. You&rsquo;ll always be young (at heart)!</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Ask the dishes.</p>

<p>The Young KL Singers is made up of members from all over, of all ages! No age limit!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YKLSHeadshotsCollage.jpg"><img src="http://www.youngklsingers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YKLSHeadshotsCollage.jpg" alt="YKLSHeadshotsCollage" /></a></p>

<p>Well&hellip;technically if you are much much younger you would be joining the 
<a href="http://www.youngchoral.my/courses/the-kl-childrens-choir">KL Children&rsquo;s Choir (KLCC)</a> first.</p>

<p>And with a mix of members, it&rsquo;s always lively and colourful that you rarely feel old (except maybe when you have to do certain choreography that tests your knees and joints). Or when a younger member casually remarks about age groups during a talk about the dating scene and receives a flying 
roti canai to the face (not that this has ever happen&hellip;yet).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll only be as old as you let yourself be.</p>

<p>So there you have it! 4 perks for being in the Young KL Singers!</p>

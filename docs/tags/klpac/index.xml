      <description>This year, the Young KL Singers joined the arts and literary world in paying tribute to William Shakespeare, as part of a global celebration of his life and works 400 years after his death. A special collaborative project between YKLS and The Actors Studio, &amp;ldquo;YKLS Does The Bard&amp;rdquo; was held from 3rd to 6th Nov 2016 at Pentas 2, KLPAC. In a very intimate and contemporary cabaret-style setting, we presented 15 choral settings of Shakespearean text which explored the universal themes of life, love and loss.</description>

      <description>If you feel that things have been getting a tad hectic, or your workload have you feeling stressed out, or you&amp;rsquo;re bummed out by goings-on around you, then it&amp;rsquo;s time for a little R&amp;amp;R.
That&amp;rsquo;s right, some Respite &amp;amp; Rhythms. For proper Rest &amp;amp; Relax we are sure you may have better ideas, but if you have only a couple of hours and need to get away from all the craziness going on in the world around you for a little while, we would like to invite you to come join us instead.</description>

      <title>Behind The Scenes, Day 1: Laundry Day</title>

      <description>And so yesterday the YKLS stepped into Indicine to start setting up the venue for Illuminations! While it may be a concert in the dark, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as just turning off all the lights (what would happen to our matinee concert, then?). Indicine, as with some of the studios in KLPAC, have glass sliding doors so that everyone can appreciate the great outdoors in the comfort of the cool indoors.</description>

      <title>Inside Intimate Indicine!</title>

      <description>8 more days until Illuminations, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be moving rehearsals to Indicine at KLPAC where we will be performing in! There&amp;rsquo;s much to be excited about!
Given the nature of the concert, Indicine presents an appropriate venue because it&amp;rsquo;s smaller and cosier (so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to strain to hear us from the back row!) and we can keep you all in the dark (literally&amp;hellip;and for now figuratively as well). There&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to do, from preparing the venue to be pitch dark, to testing the sound in the new space, making adjustments and going for dim sum dinner.</description>

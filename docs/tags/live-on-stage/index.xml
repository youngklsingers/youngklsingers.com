      <description>Live on Stage is coming! This is an event where members of the Young KL Singers can finally showcase their own thing, whether it be a solo piece, a boy band / girl group / mixed team song, however you want it. As most of the year would be spent preparing for the production this is a time where members can actually perform anything they like, in costume too!
A piece of trivia:&amp;gt;Live on Stage concept actually originated from a small scale Valentine production that we did back in 2003 entitled &amp;ldquo;Love Is In The Air&amp;rdquo;.</description>

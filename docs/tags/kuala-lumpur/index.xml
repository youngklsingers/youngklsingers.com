      <description>Well, at least that&amp;rsquo;s true for a group of people participating in a choir in a Connecticut town, as found in the results of a joint study by Harvard and Yale Universities (2008). If that&amp;rsquo;s not enough to convince you, this article from CMUSE gives you a few more reasons to join choral singing.*Strengthen feeling of togetherness . In today&amp;rsquo;s increasingly &amp;ldquo;me first&amp;rdquo; society, it is nice to find a tribe to belong to.</description>

      <description>If you feel that things have been getting a tad hectic, or your workload have you feeling stressed out, or you&amp;rsquo;re bummed out by goings-on around you, then it&amp;rsquo;s time for a little R&amp;amp;R.
That&amp;rsquo;s right, some Respite &amp;amp; Rhythms. For proper Rest &amp;amp; Relax we are sure you may have better ideas, but if you have only a couple of hours and need to get away from all the craziness going on in the world around you for a little while, we would like to invite you to come join us instead.</description>

      <title>Behind The Scenes, Day 1: Laundry Day</title>

      <description>And so yesterday the YKLS stepped into Indicine to start setting up the venue for Illuminations! While it may be a concert in the dark, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as just turning off all the lights (what would happen to our matinee concert, then?). Indicine, as with some of the studios in KLPAC, have glass sliding doors so that everyone can appreciate the great outdoors in the comfort of the cool indoors.</description>

      <title>Inside Intimate Indicine!</title>

      <description>8 more days until Illuminations, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be moving rehearsals to Indicine at KLPAC where we will be performing in! There&amp;rsquo;s much to be excited about!
Given the nature of the concert, Indicine presents an appropriate venue because it&amp;rsquo;s smaller and cosier (so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to strain to hear us from the back row!) and we can keep you all in the dark (literally&amp;hellip;and for now figuratively as well). There&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to do, from preparing the venue to be pitch dark, to testing the sound in the new space, making adjustments and going for dim sum dinner.</description>

      <description>Music can be a lot of things to different people: it can remind you of something, somewhere or someone, it can elicit emotions.
The sense of adventure and epic saga to expect when you hear the main theme to Star Wars or The Legend of Zelda. The dread when you hear the theme from Jaws. The feeling of awe and terror from Karl Jenkin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Dies Irae&amp;rsquo; from his Requiem. The spiralling feeling of despair when Lux Aeterna from Requiem For A Dream starts to play.</description>

      <description>If a picture is a thousand words, music is a thousand pictures. Each rise and fall, every silence in between is a feeling, an image, a memory.
Now if you closed your eyes, would music be different?
Would the colours burn brighter, clearer than ever?
Join us this 6-9 August as we go on a search for answers. Guided by an exquisite repertoire of music, we will be creating an atmosphere that will truly heighten the auditory senses and unleash your imagination!</description>

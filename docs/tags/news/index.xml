      <description>WHY JOIN US?
&amp;ldquo;I joined for the harmony but also experienced comedy, drama and possibly some therapy!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Meeting like minded people who enjoyed making beautiful music together - it became like a safe haven for me. I formed life-long friendships and we had many wonderful experiences I will never forget.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I went into YKLS but never came back out. Not because I was lost, it&amp;rsquo;s because I have found &amp;ldquo;</description>

      <description>We can&amp;rsquo;t thank everybody enough for the amazing KL run of Incantations!
We certainly did not expect 3&amp;frasl;4 full-house shows, and it was especially great to have performed to the (slightly scared :P) children from PPR Pantai, elderly residents of the Rumah Kebajikan Ci Hang-Chempaka and choir singers from the National Council of the Blind at the Charity Matinee.
So it&amp;rsquo;s Penang this 7-9 Nov, and we promise you it&amp;rsquo;ll be nothing less awesome.</description>

      <description>We are excited and very pleased to announce that YKLS have been invited by Petronas to perform part of our Illuminations programme at the launch of the &amp;lsquo;Illusion&amp;rsquo; exhibition at Petrosains on Thursday 10th Sept!
&amp;lsquo;Illusion - Nothing Is As It Seems&amp;rsquo; exhibition, developed by Dublin Science Museum is a part art, part science retrospective of specially created works which explores the phenomenon of the seen and unseen world in our eyes.</description>

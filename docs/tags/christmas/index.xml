      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s four more days to the show!
So here&amp;rsquo;s four random facts about YKLS and choir in general.1. Four, Squared There are four main vocal parts in a choir: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.
There was one time when even the four parts were further split into 4 parts each: Soprano 1a, Soprano 1b, Soprano 2a, Soprano 2b, Alto 1a, Alto 1b, Alto 2a, Alto 2b, Tenor 1a, Tenor 1b, Tenor 2a, Tenor 2b, Bass 1a, Bass 1b, Bass 2a and Bass 2b!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s five more days until Christmas Around The World! And while waiting for the weekend, let&amp;rsquo;s have a little guessing game about the production!
As the name implies, YKLS will be bringing you nativity songs from around the world and not just the usual Christmas carols we&amp;rsquo;re all used to. Just as with our last Christmas production (The YKLS Christmas Project), the songs may not necessarily be in English - we introduced a few other carols in French, Spanish and even in English that&amp;rsquo;s not commonly heard here!</description>

      <title>Christmas Carolling, YKLS Style</title>

      <description>After every production, there&amp;rsquo;s always that lull near the end of the year where members get restless because there are no more rehearsals, no more singing and no more meeting up until next year. And so to help alleviate choir withdrawal symptoms, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s the post-production viewing party and carolling rehearsals.
Carolling!

That is, if we&amp;rsquo;re lucky and have been approached for a gig and if we get enough members to participate - after all, carolling gigs tend to be held near Christmas when everyone will have their own celebrations and holidays.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s November! And with it, another eight more Fridays until Christmas!
And six more Sundays until the upcoming YKLS Christmas production! This will be the second Christmas production that the Young KL Singers will be performing (well, third, if taking into account Scrooge The Musical in 2005).
In the earlier years YKLS would have 2 productions in a year, and there were also carolling gigs at the year end as well (hey, check out the YKLS milestones!</description>

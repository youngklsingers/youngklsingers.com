      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s one more day until Illuminations opens! It&amp;rsquo;s an exciting time as we polish up the performance for your entertainment! And while we&amp;rsquo;re not polishing up our act, we&amp;rsquo;re polishing up our meals.

Because this year there are helpful members offering to food for others - so everyone meets downstairs at KLPAC to mooch on nasi lemak ayam / sotong, KFC and dim sum!

The Young KL Singers. Big on singing, big on eating.</description>

      <description>If you feel that things have been getting a tad hectic, or your workload have you feeling stressed out, or you&amp;rsquo;re bummed out by goings-on around you, then it&amp;rsquo;s time for a little R&amp;amp;R.
That&amp;rsquo;s right, some Respite &amp;amp; Rhythms. For proper Rest &amp;amp; Relax we are sure you may have better ideas, but if you have only a couple of hours and need to get away from all the craziness going on in the world around you for a little while, we would like to invite you to come join us instead.</description>

      <title>Behind The Scenes, Day 1: Laundry Day</title>
      <link>https://youngklsingers.com/behind-the-scenes-day-1-laundry-day/</link>

      <description>And so yesterday the YKLS stepped into Indicine to start setting up the venue for Illuminations! While it may be a concert in the dark, it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as just turning off all the lights (what would happen to our matinee concert, then?). Indicine, as with some of the studios in KLPAC, have glass sliding doors so that everyone can appreciate the great outdoors in the comfort of the cool indoors.</description>

      <title>Inside Intimate Indicine!</title>

      <description>8 more days until Illuminations, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be moving rehearsals to Indicine at KLPAC where we will be performing in! There&amp;rsquo;s much to be excited about!
Given the nature of the concert, Indicine presents an appropriate venue because it&amp;rsquo;s smaller and cosier (so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to strain to hear us from the back row!) and we can keep you all in the dark (literally&amp;hellip;and for now figuratively as well). There&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to do, from preparing the venue to be pitch dark, to testing the sound in the new space, making adjustments and going for dim sum dinner.</description>

      <description>Music can be a lot of things to different people: it can remind you of something, somewhere or someone, it can elicit emotions.
The sense of adventure and epic saga to expect when you hear the main theme to Star Wars or The Legend of Zelda. The dread when you hear the theme from Jaws. The feeling of awe and terror from Karl Jenkin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Dies Irae&amp;rsquo; from his Requiem. The spiralling feeling of despair when Lux Aeterna from Requiem For A Dream starts to play.</description>

      <description>If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing about the Young KL Singers, it&amp;rsquo;s that there&amp;rsquo;s always something new every year - whether it be singalongs from musicals, breaking it down with jazz pieces, celebrating our musical and cultural heritage and even choral music inspired by traditions and rituals all over the world, it&amp;rsquo;s certain that the Young KL Singers are an adventurous bunch to tackle different genres.
This year though, the Young KL Singers are going to be doing something totally different from the previous years.</description>

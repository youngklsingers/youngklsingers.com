Originally this was going to be titled '8 Perks of Being in YKLS' but half of them seem to be pretty much what you expect from joining a choir, and you didn't come here to read about obvious advantages, right?

You did? Oh. Okay, then.

1. You learn singing techniques to up your game.
2. You pick up loads of new songs and choral arrangements.
3. You experience what it is to be part of a production, from rehearsals to bumping in at the venue to tech runs until the end of the performance.
4. You make new friends.

So let's move on to the 4 perks you may not really realise that are also great perks of being in the Young KL Singers! Also more pictures!


**5. Defeat stress in multiple ways.**

YKLS provides stress relief in so many ways!

*Rehearsals are generally on Mondays, giving you something to look forward to and thus not get bogged down by the Monday Blues.

	
*Singing. Cheers. You. Up!

	
*More often than not you get crazy antics taking place (as you can see in the photo above, no don't worry our producers don't kill people).


**6. Let your hair down in public.**


Because everyone is a bit nutty inside, and you're in good company. Sometimes the nuttiness doesn't just happen within our choir centre, but spills outside into the public. At the mamak and trying to place your order? Call the 
 in a four-note chord to grab his attention! Waiting for the train? Sing!

Even the station guards weren't prepared to deal with our crazy.

Which are themed. Zombie peasants were wandering about Bangsar one year.


**7. Experience performing in other events.**


Sometimes it's more than just performing in a Young KL Singers production. Some years there's carolling. YKLS has also performed with the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra in the 
Lord of the Rings Symphony and also 
Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton. Some years it was participating in Choir Games.

Every year is always different and refreshingly so!


**8. You'll always be young (at heart)!**


Don't believe me? Ask the dishes.

Well...technically if you are much much younger you would be joining the 
[KL Children's Choir (KLCC)](http://www.youngchoral.my/courses/the-kl-childrens-choir) first.

And with a mix of members, it's always lively and colourful that you rarely feel old (except maybe when you have to do certain choreography that tests your knees and joints). Or when a younger member casually remarks about age groups during a talk about the dating scene and receives a flying 
roti canai to the face (not that this has ever happen...yet).

You'll only be as old as you let yourself be.

So there you have it! 4 perks for being in the Young KL Singers!

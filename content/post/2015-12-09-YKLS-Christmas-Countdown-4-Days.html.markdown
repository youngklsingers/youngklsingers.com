It's four more days to the show!

So here's four random facts about YKLS and choir in general.1. Four, Squared
There are four main vocal parts in a choir: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.

There was one time when even the four parts were further split into 4 parts each: Soprano 1a, Soprano 1b, Soprano 2a, Soprano 2b, Alto 1a, Alto 1b, Alto 2a, Alto 2b, Tenor 1a, Tenor 1b, Tenor 2a, Tenor 2b, Bass 1a, Bass 1b, Bass 2a and Bass 2b!

Try and guess which performance YKLS was in that had that many parts!

2. Rehearsing Four So Long
Not so long after our Illuminations production, members began rehearsals for Christmas Around The World. So there's only four months to prepare for the production!

And for carolling the year before, we had four weeks!

3. Four Show Only
Christmas Around The World is the fourth gig this year! There's been 
Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton, 
, and the 
Illusion exhibition at Petrosains earlier this year!

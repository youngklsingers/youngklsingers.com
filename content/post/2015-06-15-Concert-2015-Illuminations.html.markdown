If a picture is a thousand words, music is a thousand pictures. Each rise and fall, each silence in beween is a feeling, an image, a memory.

Now if you close your eyes, would the music be different?

Would the colours burn brighter, clearer than ever?

Join us this 6th - 9th August as we go on a search for answers. Guided by an exquisite repertoire of music, we will be creating an atmosphere that will truly heighten the auditory senses and unleash your imagination!****

If there's one thing about the Young KL Singers, it's that there's always something new every year - whether it be singalongs from musicals, breaking it down with jazz pieces, celebrating our musical and cultural heritage and even choral music inspired by traditions and rituals all over the world, it's certain that the Young KL Singers are an adventurous bunch to tackle different genres.

This year though, the Young KL Singers are going to be doing something totally different from the previous years.

This year, it's all about the sound.

That's right! No choreographed dances, no set pieces, no make-up and costumes. No light, even.

A whole concert - in the dark.

So come on in, get a spot, sit back and relax while you let your imagination take you places with our music. This year's concert is definitely going to take you places without leaving your seat!

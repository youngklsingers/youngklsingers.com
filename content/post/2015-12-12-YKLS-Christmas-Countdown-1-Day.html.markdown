It's one more day to the show! We've got an exciting line-up and fine-tuning it in preparation for tomorrow!

And you'll have the opportunity to take a bit of time off from Christmas shopping with the masses (unless you've already completed your Christmas shopping, Â which then we'll say, "Well done, you!"), come to Ruang, relax and be entertained, have a bite to eat and mingle, then when you're fully recharged, head back to continue your Christmas shopping!

In case you're wondering where Ruang is located, here's a map to get there!

As Ruang is located outside among the shoplots, we would advise that you come early to scout for parking spots. Don't worry, YKLS members will be carpooling to free up bays for you!

We'll be seeing you tomorrow!

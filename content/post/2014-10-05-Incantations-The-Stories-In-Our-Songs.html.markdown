Speaking of mermaids...did you know that Ulek Mayang is about a battle to save a fisherman from having surrendered his soul to a beautiful sea princess?

Every song we will sing in Incantations has a beautiful tale behind it. In this video, the choir gives you a little glimpse at what these stories are. To feel the full magic, come join us October 16-19 @ DPAC. Enjoy the video!

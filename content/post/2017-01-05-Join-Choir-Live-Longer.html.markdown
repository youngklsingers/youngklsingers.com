Well, at least that's true for a group of people participating in a choir in a Connecticut town, as found in the results of a joint study by Harvard and Yale Universities (2008). If that's not enough to convince you, this
[article from CMUSE](http://www.cmuse.org/psychological-and-physical-benefits-of-choral-singing/) gives you a few more reasons to join choral singing.***Strengthen feeling of togetherness**
. In today's increasingly "me first" society, it is nice to find a tribe to belong to.


***Regulate heart rate**
. Fun fact - did you know that when a choir sings, the members' hearts beat in unison? Reducing the variability of your heart rate can be good for your health.


***Reduce stress levels and depression**
. Group singing helps boost levels of oxytocin, which is a great stress-buster. Just what you need after a hectic day at work!
The Young KL Singer's 2017 season is starting on 9th Jan 2017, and boy, do we have an exciting year planned ahead! We look forward to welcoming new members to our group. Auditions are available for all male and female voice parts.

"Raw and uncut, live and unplugged" are the modern translation of how William Shakespeare's plays were staged more than 400 years ago before his passing. Despite his tragic death at 52, the legacy of the Bard of Avon lives on and continues to inspire artists and musicians alike to interpret his works in various ways.

This November, the Young KL Singers brings to you a programme of music set to the poetry and text of William Shakespeare, performed in an intimate cabaret setting for a heartfelt celebration with the audience the love of music and literature. A fine set of repertoire was crafted with aims to broaden views on the relationship between genres
of art and draw a truly personal experience.****

It's November! And with it, another eight more Fridays until Christmas!

And six more Sundays until the upcoming YKLS Christmas production! This will be the second Christmas production that the Young KL Singers will be performing (well, third, if taking into account 
Scrooge The Musical in 2005).

In the earlier years YKLS would have 2 productions in a year, and there were also carolling gigs at the year end as well (hey, check out the 
[YKLS milestones](http://www.youngklsingers.com/concerts/past-concerts/)!). By the 5th year it's been changed to having a single production each year instead, although there were other activities and gigs within the year as well to keep us all busy.

Then in 2012, after celebrating 10 years of YKLS with the Popzzical production in August, everyone was restless for more singing. And so, there came...The YKLS Christmas Project.

Instead of the usual Christmas carols or more familiar pieces, the Christmas Project featured nativity pieces from other parts of the world and was a great repertoire to perform. With the theme of 'Light', the audience were surrounded by loads of Christmas festival lights and candles to give that sort of 'candlelight service' impression.

That wasn't how our venue looked like - it's a shame that we don't have much (if any!) media of the event.

Fast forward 3 years, and we'll be having another Christmas production! Once again we'll be bringing you more Christmas music from around the world - stay tuned for details!

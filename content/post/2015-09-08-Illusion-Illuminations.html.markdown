We are excited and very pleased to announce that YKLS have been invited by Petronas to perform part of our Illuminations programme at the launch of the 'Illusion' exhibition at Petrosains on Thursday 10th Sept!

'Illusion - Nothing Is As It Seems' exhibition, developed by Dublin Science Museum is a part art, part science retrospective of specially created works which explores the phenomenon of the seen and unseen world in our eyes. The exhibition is currently touring around the world. Malaysia will be the first stop in Asia.

You can learn more about the Illusion exhibition at the 
[Petrosains website here](http://www.petrosains.com.my/page/public/illusion-about.php) and at the 
[Dublin Science Gallery website here](https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/illusion), and watch a bit of what it is about in the video below (click on the image)!

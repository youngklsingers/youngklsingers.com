And we're back after a short break!

Rehearsals are starting again tonight, along with auditions for anyone who's interested! Even though Illuminations is over, we still have a surprise in store for you before the end of this year as we bring you some more choral lovin'!

For current (and old) members, this means you don't have to wait until next year to get your choir kicks again, and for those interested in singing and performing with the YKLS, this is a chance for you to join in the fun without having to wait until next year! Drop by tonight at 7.30pm onwards!

Stay tuned, we'll let you know more in the upcoming weeks!

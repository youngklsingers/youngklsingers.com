8 more days until Illuminations, and we'll be moving rehearsals to Indicine at KLPAC where we will be performing in! There's much to be excited about!

Given the nature of the concert, Indicine presents an appropriate venue because it's smaller and cosier (so you won't have to strain to hear us from the back row!) and we can keep you all in the dark (literally...and for now figuratively as well). There's still plenty to do, from preparing the venue to be pitch dark, to testing the sound in the new space, making adjustments and going for dim sum dinner.

Yes, dim sum dinner! Goodbye, mamak fare near Young Choral Academy. Hello, dim sum near KL Performing Arts Centre. YKLS members have a passion for their food, something apparent during our trips to perform in Penang.

It won't be long before we're ready to illuminate you all at the concert (don't worry, no dim sum breath)!

And it's a wrap for Illuminations!

It's been a great journey for every one of us, and we would like to thank all of you who could make it to experience the show. Thank you for your support!

To the Dignity children and the members from the Malaysian Association of the Blind, we're glad to have shared this experience with you with us and we hope we have managed to entertain you!

Everyone worked hard, and even though we were all hidden away in this production there was still a lot of things to be done - memorising music, teamwork and coordination to ensure members are in sync (even though we are all in different areas of the room surround in darkness!), the stage manager and crew to ensure the show runs smoothly, the visual effects designer Alex who created great visuals that greatly enhanced the music, the production team led by our very capable producer Hwee Yin, and our musical director Chi Hoe for the repertoire of music!

Our last show has finished, and we're cleaning up Indicine to make way for other shows to come. Tonight, the Young KL Singers will be celebrating the end of Illuminations with the Cast Party! As Cast Party goes, this one is also themed (although no 
[spooky hantus to wander KL](http://www.youngklsingers.com/4-perks-of-being-in-ykls/) this time!), and we're going Futuristic this year! Would we have spacemen wandering about KL? Cyborgs / Robots / Androids? Who knows! We'll find out tonight!

But don't worry, you won't have long to wait 'til you hear from us again. Watch this space - we have a treat for you for the end of the year!

It's five more days until Christmas Around The World! And while waiting for the weekend, let's have a little guessing game about the production!

As the name implies, YKLS will be bringing you nativity songs from around the world and not just the usual Christmas carols we're all used to. Just as with our last Christmas production (The YKLS Christmas Project), the songs may not necessarily be in English - we introduced a few other carols in French, Spanish and even in English that's not commonly heard here!

It's certainly a pleasant change from what you're treated to in shopping malls, that's for sure.

So why not take an educated guess* as what language we'll be performing in for you this time! Make a list and see if you got them right!

 *if you know where to look, that is!

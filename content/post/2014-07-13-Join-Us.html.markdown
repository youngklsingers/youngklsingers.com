Ever wanted to be part of a choir?

Interested in singing and performing, whether just within the choir or on stage to an audience?

Concerned that you may need a musical background, or that it'll be hard work?

Mark your calendars! The Young KL Singers will be having auditions soon!

As a community choir, the Young KL Singers welcomes everyone to join in the fun - no music knowledge required beforehand (you'll learn as you go along), you get to perform in various places, you meet all sorts of people with the same passion, and while it will be hard work when you prepare for a performance (hey, good things never come easy) when it's over you'll find that 
it was worth the effort.

And best yet? You won't even have to wait until next year to perform!

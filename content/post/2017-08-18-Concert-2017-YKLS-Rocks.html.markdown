<!--more-->

Presented in two contrasting halves, chronological vs sub-genres, the audience will be brought through a choral journey of rock music backed by ETA, a 4-piece band. The first half of the programme will showcase the choir's vocal prowess with a more mean and lean direction meanwhile you can expect a lighter second half done a la "sing-off" format.

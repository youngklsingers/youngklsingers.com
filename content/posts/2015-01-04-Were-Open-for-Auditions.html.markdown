**WHY JOIN US?**

"I joined for the harmony but also experienced comedy, drama and possibly some therapy!"

"Meeting like minded people who enjoyed making beautiful music together - it became like a safe haven for me. I formed life-long friendships and we had many wonderful experiences I will never forget."

"I went into YKLS but never came back out. Not because I was lost, it's because I have found "

**And this author's favourite (drumroll! Ratatatatata...) -**

 "I was lonely, and then I found a girlfriend in the choir. 7 years later, we're still in the choir... AND we're engaged!"

**PLUS:**

No musical or singing background required.

You know you wanna! See you at rehearsals!

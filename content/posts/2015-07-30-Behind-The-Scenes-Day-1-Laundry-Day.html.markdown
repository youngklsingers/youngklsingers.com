And so yesterday the YKLS stepped into Indicine to start setting up the venue for Illuminations! While it may be a concert in the dark, it's not as straightforward as just turning off all the lights (what would happen to our matinee concert, then?). Indicine, as with some of the studios in KLPAC, have glass sliding doors so that everyone can appreciate the great outdoors in the comfort of the cool indoors.

So what goes on?

Drapes. It's like laundry day, what with all the white cloth, clothes pegs and safety pins!

Testing out how itÂ sounds behind the drapes!

Don't worry, we won't be installing grass on the floor and wind machines and the smell of softeners!

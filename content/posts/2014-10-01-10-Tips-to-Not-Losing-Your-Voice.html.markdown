Now, if you’ve watched the Little Mermaid, you know that Ariel took forever to get together with Prince Erik because Ursula cast a spell (!) and stole Ariel’s voice.
At YKLS, we learn fast – drawing from Ariel’s harrowing experience, we are very careful in making sure we don’t lose our voices, especially when concert’s only 2 weeks away!

And because we believe everybody can and should sing, whether or not you wish to marry a handsome prince, we would like to share with you:

**YKLS’ 10 Personal Tips to Not Losing Your Voice!**

<!--more-->


*1 part apple cider vinegar, 2 parts warm water and honey to taste! OR if you have a cough, lemon juice/apple cider vinegar, pinch of salt, honey to taste, 1tbsp grated ginger and 1/4 tsp powdered turmeric. The ginger and turmeric are important!

	
*If you have a sore throat, gargle with salt solution before bed and in the morning. It has to be really salty, like 1 tsp of salt per glass of water.

	
*If your voice is tired, drink raw honey, cold water and a few drops of lemon essential oil.

	
*Avoid whispering.

	
*Avoid shouting.

	
*Avoid cold drinks, durian (sigh), mango (sigh), ice cream (sigh), chocolate (sigh), deep-fried food (SIGH), dairy (causes phlegm).

	
*Apparently Lea Salonga practises singing in a pool with the whole body is submerged to train the diaphragm.

	
*Suck on a chewable Vitamin C before bed/ while sleeping. Not for people who choke easily.

	
*Eat one hour before singing to oil up those awesome vocal chords, drink in 10 minute intervals…then 10 minutes before singing, take some Strepsils. VOILA! Good voice AND good breath!

	
*Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa.

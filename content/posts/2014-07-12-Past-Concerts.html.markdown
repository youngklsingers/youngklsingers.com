**2015: YKLS Does The Bard**

This year, the Young KL Singers joined the arts and literary world in paying tribute to William Shakespeare, as part of a global celebration of his life and works 400 years after his death. A special collaborative project between YKLS and The Actors Studio, “YKLS Does The Bard” was held from 3rd to 6th Nov 2016 at Pentas 2, KLPAC. In a very intimate and contemporary cabaret-style setting, we presented 15 choral settings of Shakespearean text which explored the universal themes of life, love and loss. In between the music, our members shared personal reflections and stories based on the themes portrayed in the songs.

**2015: Illuminations**

If a picture is a thousand words, music is a thousand pictures. Each rise and fall, each silence in between is a feeling, an image, a memory.

Now if you close your eyes, would the music be different?

Would the colours burn brighter, clearer than ever?

Join us as we go on a search for answers. Guided by an exquisite repertoire of music, we will be creating an atmosphere that will truly heighten the auditory senses and unleash your imagination!
